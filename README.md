# Unit-16 Hack or Snooze
https://curric.springboard.com/software-engineering-career-track/default/exercises/hack-or-snooze-ajax-api/


IF I had designed this project myself I would have kept the user's favorites in localStorage instead of making calls to the api, but it seemed like that's what the
project directions were calling for so that's what I did.

If I had more time I would have put error handling on the sign in/ login form to catch for invalid input and to catch for when you try to signup with a preexisting
username. As it is now, it runs into bugs if you sign up with an old username.
